# Power-Platform-Business-Solution
This repository showcases my final project for the **Microsoft Power Up Program**: A complete Power Platform solution designed to streamline parking operations.

My solution included: Dataverse tables and model-driven apps to canvas apps, Power Automate flows, and Power BI dashboards, all aimed at solving real-world parking management issues for a school.

## Solution Overview
- **Model-Driven App**: `C.H.S. Parking Solution`
- **Canvas App**: `Park Mate`
- **Dataverse Tables**: Custom entities for parking slots, vehicles, and users
- **Power Automate Flows**: Automated notifications, slot status updates, and reporting
- **Power BI Report**: Visual insights into parking usage, revenue, and trends.
